# Mariam's WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

# My portfolio

> Note:

Hello there üòä

I‚Äôm **Mariam Yusuff**, a technical writer who believes documentation should feel like a guide, not a maze.  

I specialize in **API documentation** and **DevOps**, focusing on how clear communication improves **developer experience** and **product usability**. My work is to make complex systems understandable through clear, developer-friendly docs built with modern Docs-as-Code workflows and static site generators.  

> Think of this portfolio as my **sandbox of clarity**, where I explore, test, and refine how documentation can help developers move faster and teams collaborate better.

**My mission:** to bridge the gap between humans and technology, one clear explanation at a time.  




## üí° Areas of Expertise & Recent Projects

| Project | Overview |

## üß© My Approach  

- **Collaboration:** I enjoy working closely with developers and product teams to build docs that align with real user needs.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Every project is an opportunity to learn a new tool, framework, or documentation best practice.  
- **Clarity & Empathy:** I write with both the engineer and the end user in mind, because great docs serve both.
