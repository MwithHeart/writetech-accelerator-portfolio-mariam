Hello there 😊

I’m **Mariam Yusuff**, a technical writer who believes documentation should feel like a guide, not a maze.  

Here you’ll find my journey through **AI documentation, API docs, DevOps, automation, and Web3**, built with modern workflows and static site generators. Think of this portfolio as my “sandbox of clarity,” where I test, learn, and refine how docs can serve people better.  



## 👩🏽‍💻 About Mariam

Docs should **teach**, not **terrify**. That’s why I write with clarity, precision, and a bit of creativity.  

My mission: to bridge the gap between humans and technology, one clear explanation at a time.
