# Mariam's WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome!  

This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains — including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 — using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Mariam

I am Mariam Yusuff, a technical writer passionate about simplifying ideas, telling meaningful stories, and creating impact through words. I write with empathy and clarity.

With a background in Mechanical Engineering and a deep interest in sustainability and technology, I’ve carved a space for myself at the intersection of technical clarity and creative expression.

I aim to bridge the gap between people and complex technological concepts because I believe that docs should bring clarity not confusion.
