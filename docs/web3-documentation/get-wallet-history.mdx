title: Get wallet history
description: Retrieve all historical transactions for a specific wallet address using the Moralis Web3 API.
---


Retrieve a detailed list of all transactions made by a wallet address, including transfers, smart contract interactions, and token movements.

---

## Description

**GET** `/wallets/:address/history`  

The wallet history API lets you view everything that’s happened with a specific wallet address on a supported blockchain. Use it to:

- Track user activity or spending history  
- Analyze smart contract interactions  
- Build dashboards or analytics tools around wallet data

## Parameters

| Name      | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string`  |  Yes    | —       | The wallet address you want to retrieve history for. Must be a valid EVM address. |
| `chain`   | `string`  |  No     | `eth`   | The blockchain network to query (e.g., `eth`, `polygon`, `bsc`)            |
| `from_block`   | `number` | No     | —    | The minimum block number from which to get the transactions |
| `to_block` |  `number` | No     | —    | The maximum block number from which to get the transactions |
| `cursor` | `string`  | No     | —       | The cursor returned in the previous response (used for getting the next page) |
| `order`  | `string`  | No     | DESC      | The order of the result, in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC)      |
| `nft_metadata` |  `boolean`  | No     | —       | Whether the result should contain the nft metadata |

:::tip   
The maximum value for `limit` is 100. If you need to fetch more results, use pagination with the `cursor` parameter.

## Common pitfalls

| Issue                  | Why It Happens                                                               | How to Fix                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactions missing   | Some blockchains (like Polygon) may delay indexing.                          | Try again in a few minutes or confirm the transaction on a block explorer. |
| `status` field missing | Not all blockchains return success/failure data for historical transactions. | Use Moralis Streams API for live confirmation instead.                     |
| Empty result set       | The wallet may be new or not active on the chain queried.                    | Double-check the address and chain value.                                  |

## Key notes

* Works for EVM-compatible chains only (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, etc.)
* Data is indexed and refreshed every few seconds, but may slightly lag behind real-time
* Rate limits apply depending on your Moralis plan

## Example use case

> Suppose you’re building a dashboard that shows a user’s on-chain activity.
> You can use this endpoint to fetch their transaction history and visualize it using a chart or table — similar to how Etherscan displays it.
