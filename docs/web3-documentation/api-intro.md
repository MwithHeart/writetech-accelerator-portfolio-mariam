# Web3 documentation project overview

In this project, I explored Web3 API documentation, focusing on how blockchain-based APIs differ from traditional Web2 APIs.  

I worked primarily with the [Moralis Web3 API](https://moralis.io/); a Web3 development platform that provides APIs for accessing blockchain data such as NFTs, tokens, and wallet transactions.

# üí° What I learned

* How Web3 APIs interact with decentralized networks through smart contracts and blockchain nodes.
* How to simplify blockchain jargon (like token addresses and wallet hashes) for readers from a Web2 background.
* The importance of contextual explanations; showing when and why to use an endpoint, not just how.

## Tools & tech stack used

| Tool / Technology | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| Moralis Web3 API | For real blockchain data |
| Postman | Test endpoints and authentication|
| Docusaurus | Structure and publish the documentation |
| Markdown/MDX | To write structured content |
| GitHub | For version control |

## Improvements made

- Rewrote poorly structured endpoint pages (e.g., *Get Wallet History*, *Get NFT Owners*) to include:

  - Clear ‚ÄúOverview,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCommon Errors‚Äù sections.
  - Organized parameter tables and realistic example requests.
- Enhanced readability and navigation using consistent tone, structure, and terminology.
- Focused on bridging the knowledge gap for developers transitioning from Web2 to Web3.

## Challenges

- Translating blockchain terminology into beginner-friendly language.
- Balancing accuracy with simplicity to avoid overwhelming new developers.
