# My portfolio

:::tip Note
This portfolio is continuously evolving. So expect updates and experiments as I grow.
::: 

Hello there 😊

I’m **Mariam Yusuff**, a technical writer who believes documentation should feel like a guide, not a maze.  

I specialize in **API documentation**, **DevOps**, and **Web3**; three worlds that power how developers build, ship, and interact with technology. My goal is to make complex systems understandable through clear, developer-friendly docs built with modern Docs-as-Code workflows and static site generators.  


> Think of this portfolio as my **sandbox of clarity**, where I explore, test, and refine how documentation can serve both people better.  

My mission: to bridge the gap between humans and technology, one clear explanation at a time.
