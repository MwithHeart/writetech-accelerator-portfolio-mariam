# My portfolio
## 👩🏽‍💻 Who am I?

I am Mariam Yusuff, a technical writer passionate about simplifying ideas, telling meaningful stories, and creating impact through words. I write with empathy and clarity.   

I aim to bridge the gap between people and complex technological concepts because I believe that docs should bring **clarity** not **confusion**.
