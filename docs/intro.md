# Welcome to my technical writing portfolio

Hello. I’m **Mariam Yusuff**, a Technical Writer specializing in **APIs, DevOps, and Cloud documentation**.  

I help developers and product teams transform complex systems such as APIs, CI/CD workflows, and infrastructure, into clear, actionable documentation that:  
    - **Reduces onboarding time**  
    - **Minimizes confusion**  
    - **Boosts developer productivity**  

💡 **My mission:** To bridge the gap between humans and technology, one clear explanation at a time.

🚀 Want to elevate your product docs or API guides?

## 💡 Core expertise & featured projects
| Project | Overview |
| ------- | -------- |
| [Documentation auditing & SSGs](./documentation-tooling/intro.mdx) | Explored SSGs and refined the documentation for **PixiEditor**, an open source 2D drawing tool, focusing on structure, clarity, and consistency |
| [API documentation & OpenAPI](./api-documentation/intro) | Enhanced documentation for **Chimoney API,** rendered OpenAPI specs, and drafted new **Dribbble API** Quickstart pages. | 
| [DevOps & cloud documentation](./devops-cloud-documentation/intro) | Created a step-by-step guide for setting up **GitHub Actions**, including a sample CI/CD pipeline with Lychee broken-link checker |
| [Docs automation](./docs-automation/intro) | Implemented automated checks using **Vale**, **Spectral**, and **GitHub Actions** to ensure style consistency, link integrity, and build reliability across projects |
| [AI for documentation](./ai-documentation/intro) | Documented a model card for **Qwen-3** and used AI-assisted techniques to generate FAQ sections for accessibility. |
| [Technical writing in Web3](./web3-documentation/api-intro) | Documented two endpoints of the **Moralis Web3 API**, creating clear reference guides that simplify blockchain concepts for developers |


## 🧩 My approach  
- **Collaboration:** Partnering with engineers, designers, and PMs to build docs grounded in real workflows.  
- **Continuous Learning:**  Every project is an opportunity to learn a new tool, framework, or documentation best practice.
- **Clarity & Empathy:** Writing for both the engineer and the end-user — because great docs serve both.
