# Reflections

Below are some of my reflections:
- AI tools are as powerful as the user.
- AI can reduce creativity so instead of getting intimidated, it's better to learn to use it ethically.
- AI can hallucinate so it's better to always verify information. 
- Overdependence on AI can be a big problem now and in the future. It's important to draw healthy boundaries where necessary.
