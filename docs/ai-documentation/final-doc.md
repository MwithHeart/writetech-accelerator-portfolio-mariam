# Qwen3 FAQ
This page contains the edited, polished version of the AI-generated FAQs.


## General

### What is Qwen3?

    Qwen3 is the laaatest generation of large language models developed by Alibaba Group's Qwen Team. It's a transformer-based language model that excels in natural language understanding, text generation, coding, and multilingual applications, supporting 119 languages and dialects.

### What model variants are available?
 - **Dense Models:** 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, and 32B parameters.

- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models:** 
    - 30B-A3B: 30B total, ~3B active per input
    - 235B-A22B: 235B total, ~22B active per input

### How many languages does Qwen3 support?

    Qwen3 supports 119 languages and dialects, significantly expanding multilingual capabilities compared to its predecessors.


### Is Qwen3 open-source?

Yes—Qwen3 is fully **open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license**. The models are accessible via platforms like Hugging Face and ModelScope.




## Usage & capabilities 

### What's the difference between thinking and non-thinking modes?
- **Thinking Mode**: The model reasons step-by-step before providing an answer, ideal for complex problems
- **Non-Thinking Mode**: Provides quick, direct responses for simpler queries



### What is the context length of Qwen 3?

- Small dense models (0.6B–4B): up to 32K tokens.

- Larger dense (8B–32B) and MoE models: up to 128K tokens.


### What makes Qwen3 stand out?
* **Hybrid reasoning**: Seamless blend of “thinking” and response modes.
* **Long context support**, with 128K token windows for most variants.
* **Agentic features**: Supports tool use, memory integration, and autonomous workflows.
* **Expanded multilingual reach**: 119 languages–enhanced accessibility.


### What's the difference between MoE and dense models?
MoE (Mixture of Experts) models have more total parameters but only activate a subset during inference, making them more efficient than dense models of similar capability.

### How do I choose the right model size?
- **0.6B-1.7B**: Mobile, edge devices, simple tasks
- **4B-8B**: General applications, moderate complexity
- **14B-32B**: Research, complex reasoning, enterprise use
- **MoE models**: Large-scale applications requiring efficiency




## Setup & access

### How can I access Qwen3 models?

* Download on **Hugging Face** and **ModelScope**
* For interactive use: Online platforms such as **chat.qwen.ai.**

### What hardware do I need to run Qwen 3?
- **0.6B–4B:** Runs well on consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 3090/4090).

- **8B–32B:** Needs high-end GPUs like NVIDIA H100.

- **MoE models**: Require multi-GPU setups due to high active parameter counts.


### How does Qwen3 compare to GPT-4 and similar models?

Qwen3 demonstrates competitive performance in reasoning, code generation, and multilingual tasks. It even rivals proprietary models like GPT-4, especially given the advantages of open-source access.



## Technical 

### What is the context length for Qwen3 models?
The context length varies by model size and is optimized for each variant. Check the specific model documentation for exact values.



### What deployment options are available?
- **Local**: Ollama, LMStudio, MLX, llama.cpp
- **Cloud**: Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, custom deployments
- **Frameworks**: vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM

## Troubleshooting

### Why are there memory errors?
- Use smaller model variants (e.g., Qwen3-4B instead of Qwen3-32B)
- Enable model sharding with `device_map="auto"`
- Use quantization techniques
- Reduce batch size or sequence length

### The model output contains only `</think>` without opening tags. Is this normal?
Yes, this is normal for Qwen3-Thinking models. The chat template automatically includes the opening `<think>` tag, so you'll only see the closing `</think>` tag in the output.

### How to reduce repetitive outputs?
Adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2. Higher values reduce repetition but may cause language mixing.

### Why is my model not using thinking mode?
- Ensure you're using a thinking-enabled model variant
- Set `enable_thinking=True` in the chat template
- Use appropriate generation parameters for thinking models



## Licensing and commercial use

### What license does Qwen3 use?
Apache 2.0 is the license for Qwen3, allowing for both research and commercial use.

### Can I use Qwen3 for commercial applications?
Yes, the Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use, modification, and distribution.

### Are there any usage restrictions?
Follow standard ethical AI guidelines and avoid generating harmful, biased, or misleading content.
