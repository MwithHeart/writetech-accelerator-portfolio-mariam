# My Prompts

This folder contains the project I'm currently working on. It's my technical writing portfolio where I'm going to be showasing the things I've learnt and I'm learning in areas like AI documentation, API documentation, documentation automation, CI/CD pipelines and so much more.  I have docusaurus installed and that's the static site generator I'm using. 
I want you to create a file under the docs\ai-documentation folder. It should contain the FAQs based on information from the qwen-3 model page. Here's the resource @web https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
