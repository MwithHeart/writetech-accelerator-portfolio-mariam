# Qwen3 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Qwen3?
Qwen3 is the latest generation of large language models developed by Alibaba Group's Qwen Team. It's a transformer-based language model that excels in natural language understanding, text generation, coding, and multilingual applications, supporting 119 languages and dialects.

### What are the main improvements in Qwen3 compared to previous versions?
- **Hybrid Thinking Modes**: Supports both thinking and non-thinking modes
- **Enhanced Multilingual Support**: 119 languages and dialects
- **Improved Coding Capabilities**: Better code generation and understanding
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: More efficient large-scale models
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enhanced agentic capabilities

### What model sizes are available?
**Dense Models:**
- Qwen3-32B (32 billion parameters)
- Qwen3-14B (14 billion parameters)
- Qwen3-8B (8 billion parameters)
- Qwen3-4B (4 billion parameters)
- Qwen3-1.7B (1.7 billion parameters)
- Qwen3-0.6B (0.6 billion parameters)

**MoE Models:**
- Qwen3-235B-A22B (235B total, 22B active parameters)
- Qwen3-30B-A3B (30B total, 3B active parameters)

## Installation and Setup

### What are the system requirements?
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **PyTorch**: 2.6 or higher
- **Transformers**: >=4.51.0
- **Hardware**: Varies by model size (GPU recommended for larger models)

### How do I install Qwen3?
```bash
pip install transformers>=4.51.0
pip install torch>=2.6.0
```

### How do I load a Qwen3 model?
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
```

## Usage Questions

### What's the difference between thinking and non-thinking modes?
- **Thinking Mode**: The model reasons step-by-step before providing an answer, ideal for complex problems
- **Non-Thinking Mode**: Provides quick, direct responses for simpler queries

### How do I use thinking mode?
```python
# Enable thinking mode in chat template
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=True  # Enable thinking mode
)
```

### What are the recommended generation parameters?
**For Instruct models:**
- `temperature=0.7`
- `top_p=0.8`
- `top_k=20`
- `min_p=0`

**For Thinking models:**
- `temperature=0.6`
- `top_p=0.95`
- `top_k=20`
- `min_p=0`

### How do I configure thinking budget?
```python
thinking_budget = 16  # Number of tokens for thinking
max_new_tokens = 32768

# First generation up to thinking budget
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=thinking_budget
)

# Check if thinking is complete and continue if needed
```

## Technical Questions

### What is the context length for Qwen3 models?
The context length varies by model size and is optimized for each variant. Check the specific model documentation for exact values.

### How do I parse thinking content from the output?
```python
# Find the </think> token (151668)
try:
    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)
except ValueError:
    index = 0

thinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True)
content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Can I use Qwen3 with OpenAI API compatibility?
Yes, Qwen3 supports OpenAI API compatibility through various deployment frameworks like vLLM and SGLang.

### What deployment options are available?
- **Local**: Ollama, LMStudio, MLX, llama.cpp
- **Cloud**: Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, custom deployments
- **Frameworks**: vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting memory errors?
- Use smaller model variants (e.g., Qwen3-4B instead of Qwen3-32B)
- Enable model sharding with `device_map="auto"`
- Use quantization techniques
- Reduce batch size or sequence length

### The model output contains only `</think>` without opening tags. Is this normal?
Yes, this is normal for Qwen3-Thinking models. The chat template automatically includes the opening `<think>` tag, so you'll only see the closing `</think>` tag in the output.

### How do I reduce repetitive outputs?
Adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2. Higher values reduce repetition but may cause language mixing.

### Why is my model not using thinking mode?
- Ensure you're using a thinking-enabled model variant
- Set `enable_thinking=True` in the chat template
- Use appropriate generation parameters for thinking models

## Performance and Optimization

### How can I improve inference speed?
- Use MoE models for better parameter efficiency
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use optimized deployment frameworks (vLLM, TensorRT)
- Consider model quantization

### What's the difference between MoE and dense models?
MoE (Mixture of Experts) models have more total parameters but only activate a subset during inference, making them more efficient than dense models of similar capability.

### How do I choose the right model size?
- **0.6B-1.7B**: Mobile, edge devices, simple tasks
- **4B-8B**: General applications, moderate complexity
- **14B-32B**: Research, complex reasoning, enterprise use
- **MoE models**: Large-scale applications requiring efficiency
