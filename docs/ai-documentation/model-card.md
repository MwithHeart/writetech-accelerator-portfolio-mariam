## Usage

### Installation
```python
# Using Transformers
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-7B"  # Example model name
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Example Usage
```python
def generate_response(prompt, model, tokenizer, max_length=100):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs.input_ids,
        max_length=max_length,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        temperature=0.7,
        do_sample=True
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example prompt
prompt = "Explain the concept of quantum computing in simple terms."
response = generate_response(prompt, model, tokenizer)
print(response)
```

## Ethical Considerations

### Limitations
- May generate incorrect or biased information
- Performance may vary across different languages and domains
- May not handle ambiguous queries well

### Recommendations
- Use with human oversight for critical applications
- Implement content filtering for production use
- Monitor for biased or harmful outputs
- Consider the environmental impact of running large models
