# Documentation auditing overview 
This project focused on auditing and restructuring documentation for PixiEditor using Docusaurus. The goal was to enhance clarity, improve navigation, and provide a consistent user experience for both beginners and advanced users.

## About PixiEditor
[PixiEditor](https://pixieditor.net) is a free, open-source Universal 2D editor that allows users to create pixel art, vector graphics and animations in 2D.  

The documentation plays a key role in helping users get started with these features. As part of this project, I identified usability issues and proposed structural improvements to make the documentation more user-friendly.  

## Scope of work

I performed the following tasks:  
- **Audited existing documentation** for tone, structure, and accuracy
- **Restructured pages** to follow a logical flow and eliminate redundant information
- **Improved technical accuracy** by clarifying terminology and steps
- **Standardized headings and tone** for consistency across the documentation

## Improved pages
### Page 1: Getting started 
Introduces users to the basics of animations.  

**Improvements made:**  
- Grouped related information to make onboarding easier
- Reorganized sections to reduce cognitive overload
- Properly annotated images for easy visibility

### Page 2: Create a Node Graph
Guides users on how to create their first Node Graph in PixiEditor.  

**Improvements made:**
- Extracted the **Node Type** information from a collapsible summary and turned it into a **dedicated heading** for better visibility
- Reorganized steps for logical flow

### Page 3: Procedural animations
Step-by-step guide to creating procedural animations  

**Improvements made:**
- Simplified tone to be more beginner-friendly
- Standardized heading levels for better readability
- Removed redundant explanations and clarified technical steps

## Challenges
- Maintaining beginner-friendly explanations while improving technical depth
- Ensuring restructuring didnâ€™t break links or navigation paths

---
## Key takeaways
- Consistency is key: A consistent structure and tone improve user confidence and comprehension
- Docs-as-code workflow matters: I learned to use version control (Git) and Docusaurus efficiently for iterative documentation improvement
- Empathy for users: Reviewing feedback and testing changes helped me prioritize clarity for first-time users
