# Reflection on writing this guide

Documenting this guide was a valuable learning experience. Here are some of what I discovered during the process:

- **Clarity Matters:** Explaining GitHub Actions to absolute beginners forced me to simplify complex ideas and break them down step by step.
- **Real-World Examples Help:** Using the Lychee Broken Link Checker workflow made CI/CD concepts feel concrete and less abstract.
- **Consistency is Key:** Naming conventions (for files, jobs, and steps) make workflows easier to read and maintain.
- **Documentation is Iterative:** I realized how important it is to test workflows and update the documentation whenever thereâ€™s a change, so readers can follow along without running into errors.   

Overall, creating this documentation improved not just my technical writing skills but also my understanding of GitHub Actions and CI/CD as a whole.
