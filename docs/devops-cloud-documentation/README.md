# CI/CD with GitHub Actions â€“ Beginner-Friendly Guide  

This project simulates a real-world DevOps documentation task.  
It is designed to help **absolute beginners** understand the core concepts of CI/CD and get hands-on experience by setting up a workflow using **GitHub Actions**.   

Rather than just theory, this documentation walks you through creating your first workflow step by step, and uses a practical example (Lychee Broken Link Checker) to make things more concrete.
