# Summary 
## CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Beginner-friendly guide  

This project simulates a real-world DevOps documentation task.  
It is designed to help **absolute beginners** understand the core concepts of CI/CD and get hands-on experience by setting up a workflow using **GitHub Actions**.   

Rather than just theory, this documentation walks you through creating your first workflow step by step, and uses a practical example (Lychee Broken Link Checker) to make things more concrete.

## üå± What I learned  

- **Breaking down complexity:** Writing for beginners forced me to simplify technical jargon and make each step crystal clear.  
- **Real-world testing matters:** Running the workflow myself helped me catch and explain errors that a beginner might face.  
- **Documentation is a skill:** I learned how to organize a project into logical sections that build on each other and keep readers engaged.

## ü™ú Next steps

Here are a few directions to explore next:

- **Explore More Actions:** Browse the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to find actions for testing, deployment, security scanning, and more.
- **Advanced Workflow Features:** Learn about matrix builds, job dependencies, caching, and environment secrets.
- **CI/CD for Your Projects:** Try applying these workflows to your personal projects ‚Äî for example, running tests automatically on pull requests or deploying a static site to GitHub Pages.

With practice, you‚Äôll build confidence in automating your development workflow and shipping faster with fewer errors.
