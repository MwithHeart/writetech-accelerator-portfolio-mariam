## Wrapping up CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

This guide provided a beginner-friendly introduction to CI/CD using GitHub Actions.   
We explored the concepts, created a workflow step by step, and tested it using a practical example with the Lychee Broken Link Checker.  


##  What I learned  

- **Breaking down complexity:** Writing for beginners forced me to simplify technical jargon and make each step crystal clear.  
- **Real-world testing matters:** Running the workflow myself helped me catch and explain errors that a beginner might face.  
- **Documentation is a skill:** I learned how to organize a project into logical sections that build on each other and keep readers engaged.  

##  Key takeaways
At the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of:    
- How GitHub Actions workflows are structured.
- How to run and customize an action.
- How to use workflow outputs to automate follow-up steps (like creating GitHub issues).


##  Next steps

Here are a few directions to explore next:

- **Explore More Actions:** Browse the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to find actions for testing, deployment, security scanning, and more.
- **Advanced Workflow Features:** Learn about matrix builds, job dependencies, caching, and environment secrets.
- **CI/CD for Your Projects:** Try applying these workflows to your personal projects — for example, running tests automatically on pull requests or deploying a static site to GitHub Pages.

With practice, you’ll build confidence in automating your development workflow and shipping faster with fewer errors.
