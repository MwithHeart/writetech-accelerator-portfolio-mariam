# I Served *breakfast* to Someone 

> **💡** Note: The word **breakfast** is a Nigerian slang for **heartbreak** or **break up**. So when you **serve breakfast** to someone, you break their heart, often by breaking up with them.  

In this brief writeup, you'll get to learn:
* Why I served breakfast to someone
* What I like about the breakfast serving
* About me (Yayyy 🤩🤩)
* The breakfast and who I served

Now, let's dive in!

It was a fateful day in Ramadan (March, 2025). I picked my pen and wrote. Wait, I didn't use a pen, I actually typed it. But yes, I wrote a break up letter. 

The link to the breakup letter is in the last paragraph of this write up but don't scroll yet, there are some key things you should know first.


## Why I served *breakfast*
We had been pals since way back, since I was a child. But still, urgent situations call for urgent measures, right? Here are some reasons why I chose the *breakfast (break up)* route: 
* I outgrew the person:   
You know, there are times when you outgrow the people around you. Your dreams change, your goals change and you need new people to nurture them. 

* It was borne out of a desire to grow.

So yes, I outgrew that person and I'm so glad I've moved on.

## What I like about the *breakfast* serving 
Here a few parts of the breakfast serving (breakup letter) that I really liked:  
| Expression | Reason |
|------------|--------|
|"Hiya Proxy"| That's the first line of the letter. I started nicely so kudos to me. |
|"Or when we leave everything until the last minute and activate our legendary *deadline mode*."| I talked about our legendary escapades and how we hardly ran into trouble. See? I'm nice.|
|"I'm sorry but I can't do this anymore"| The nail in the coffin, right at the end. Again, you don't have to mention it; I know I'm nice. 😂 |

## Who I Served Breakfast To
Back to the topic at hand.  
In case you haven't figured out --- which you probably haven't because I didn't explicitly mention it --- I broke up with **procrastination**. I'm in a good phase of my life to ditch that old friend and team up with **Discipline**, right? 😊
