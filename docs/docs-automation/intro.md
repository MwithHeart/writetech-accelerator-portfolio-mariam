# Documentation automation
This project shows demonstration of my skills in using the CI/CD workflow, including but not limited to the use of:
- vale, for linting while following the Google developer documentation
- markdown link check, for detecting broken rules
- spectral for linting, while following the OpenAPI specification rules



## Improvements 
- Using the cI/CD workflow saves time and improves efficiency.
- With CI/CD, documentation is updated faster and seamlessly. 




## Challenges
- Getting an API key on the Chimoney sandbox was confusing initially.



## Key takeaways
- I learnt how to test API endpoints with postman.
