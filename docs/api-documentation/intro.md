# Chimoney API documentation overview
This project documents key parts of the Chimoney REST API including:
    - A getting started section
    - Endpoints written in markdown
    - Endpoint rendered using the docusaurus open-api plugin
    

## What is Chimoney?
Chimoney is a platform that allows for efficient payments across borders, multi-currency wallets and global payouts. For more information, see the [Chimoney website](https://chimoney.io).


## Improvements 
1. **Improved Onboarding:** The actual ```getting started``` page seems like a simple guide that talks about products that can be built with the API. I restructured it into something more hands-on, including:
    - How to create an account
    - Authentication
    - The base URL
    - A sample Postman request

2. **Structured Endpoint Pages** Created pages for two endpoints implementing proper structure and codeblocks for displaying responses. 


## Challenges
- Getting an API key on the Chimoney sandbox was confusing initially.


## Key takeaways
- I learnt how to test API endpoints with postman. 
- I learnt how to interpret OpenAPI specification
