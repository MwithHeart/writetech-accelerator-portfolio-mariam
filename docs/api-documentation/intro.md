# Chimoney API documentation project
This project documents the Chimoney REST API, including a Getting Started section and selected endpoints.

## Live Site (For GitHub Readme)
[Chimoney API Docs](https://chimoney.io) site


## What I Improved
1. The actual getting started page seems like a simple guide that talks about products that can be built with the API. I restructured it into something more hands-on, including:
- how to create an account
- authentication
- the base URL
- A sample Postman request

**Example improvement:**

2. I restructured paragraphs and made them easier to understand. In the image below, the **Node Type** was added as a summary in the middle of a list. I moved it below the list and brough it out as a separate heading instead of a collapsible summary that readers can easily overlook.
**Example improvement:**

3. I noticed information on the [Getting started with animations] page was slightly scattered so I grouped similar information.

## Challenges
- It was challenging usi choosing an open source project in the first place. 



## What I Learnt
- I learnt how important documentation is, all over again. I noticed some pages in the Chimoney docs had probably been updated regarding tone and structure, while some had not.
