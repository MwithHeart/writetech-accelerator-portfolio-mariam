# Chimoney API documentation project
This project documents the Chimoney REST API, including a Getting Started section and selected endpoints.

## Live Site 
[Chimoney API Docs](https://chimoney.io) site


## What I Improved
1. The actual getting started page seems like a simple guide that talks about products that can be built with the API. I restructured it into something more hands-on, including:
- how to create an account
- authentication
- the base URL
- A sample Postman request


## Challenges
- Getting an API key on the Chimoney sandbox was confusing initially.



## What I Learnt
- I learnt how to test API endpoints with postman.
