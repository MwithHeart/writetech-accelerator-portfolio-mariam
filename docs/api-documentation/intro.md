# Chimoney API documentation project
This project documents the Chimoney REST API, including a Getting Started section and selected endpoints.

## Chimoney
Chimoney is a platform that allows for efficient payments across borders, multi-currency wallets and global payouts.  
You can check the website site [here](https://chimoney.io).



## Improvements 
1. **Improved Onboarding:** The actual ```getting started``` page seems like a simple guide that talks about products that can be built with the API. I restructured it into something more hands-on, including:
- How to create an account
- Authentication
- The base URL
- A sample Postman request

2. **Structured Endpoint Pages** Created pages for two endpoints implementing proper structure and codeblocks for displaying responses. 


## Challenges
- Getting an API key on the Chimoney sandbox was confusing initially.


## Key takeaways
- I learnt how to test API endpoints with postman. 
- I learnt how to interpret OpenAPI specification
