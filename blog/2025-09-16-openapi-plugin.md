This guide explains how to render an OpenAPI YAML file on docusaurus with the docusaurus-openapi-docs plugin.  

<!-- truncate -->
For this guide:
    - the Windows OS was used.
    - The docusaurus project is Javascript only
    - The project deploys on Vercel.


Write the API specification inside a yaml file and save. I saved the yaml file as ai-invoice.yaml under the path docs/api-documentation/reference/ai-invoice.yaml. 
This path means the ai-invoice.yaml is under a folder named reference, which is in a folder named api-documentation. And api-documentation is in a folder named docs. The docs folder should have been created automatically when you installed docusaurus.  

## Step 1: Install the plugin and theme
    ```
    ## Using npm
    npm install docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs

    ## or yarn
    yarn add docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs
    ```

## Step 2: Configure the plugin in docusaurus.config.js
In docusaurus.config, look for presets and update it to resemble this:
```    // docusaurus.config.js (partial)
    module.exports = {
    // ... your existing config ...
    presets: [
        [
        'classic',
        {
            docs: {
            sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
            // use ApiItem to get the OpenAPI UI components
            docItemComponent: '@theme/ApiItem',
            },
            theme: { customCss: './src/css/custom.css' },  // This line may already be there. If it is, do not add it again.
        },
        ],
    ],

    plugins: [
        [
        'docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs',
        {
            id: 'api',                 // unique id for this plugin instance
            docsPluginId: 'classic',   // use the preset classic docs instance
            config: {
            aiInvoice: {
                specPath: 'docs/api-documentation/reference/ai-invoice.yaml',  	// This is the path to the yaml file
                outputDir: 'docs/api-documentation/api-reference',  
                sidebarOptions: {
                groupPathsBy: 'tag',            // optional: group endpoints by tag
                },
            },
            },
        },
        ],
    ],
    themes: ['docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs'],
    };
```

Important things to note;  
- specPath: is the path to the yaml file. Mine is 'docs/api-documentation/reference/ai-invoice.yaml'
- outputDir: is the path to the folder where I want the plugin to generate the MDX files 'docs/api-documentation/api-referenceâ€™  
Adjust both based on your project. 

## Step 3: Tell your sidebars.js to show the generated docs 
You should have a sidebar.js at the root of your repository. 
```        // sidebars.js
    module.exports = {
    // your main docs sidebar (example)
    portfolioSidebar: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }],

    // This is the new sidebar for API docs (which shows everything under docs/api-reference)
    apiAutomationSidebar: [
        { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'api-reference' },
    ],
    };
```
For me, I wanted to include the generated file under a sidebar navigation named API Documentation. So i did this
